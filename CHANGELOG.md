# Changelog

> **Strong Roots. Inspired Growth.**

This document records the notable changes made to BAOBAB throughout its development.

The changelog provides a clear and concise history of the platform's evolution, enabling users, contributors, maintainers, and other stakeholders to understand what has changed between releases and why those changes matter.

BAOBAB follows the principles of **Keep a Changelog** while adopting **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** to ensure releases are communicated consistently and transparently.

---

# Purpose

The objectives of this changelog are to:

- Document significant changes introduced in each release.
- Improve transparency between releases.
- Help users understand the impact of upgrading.
- Provide a historical record of the platform's evolution.
- Support release planning and maintenance.
- Promote consistent release documentation across the project.

Only changes that are meaningful to users, contributors, maintainers, or system operators should be included.

---

# Release Philosophy

BAOBAB treats every release as an engineering milestone rather than simply a collection of commits.

Each release should:

- Deliver measurable value.
- Maintain platform stability.
- Preserve backwards compatibility wherever practical.
- Clearly communicate breaking changes.
- Highlight security-related improvements.
- Provide sufficient context for users to understand the release.

A release should tell the story of how the platform has evolved—not merely list technical changes.

---

# Versioning Policy

BAOBAB follows **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**.

Version numbers use the format:

```text
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

For example:

```text
1.4.2
```

Where:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **MAJOR** | Introduces incompatible or breaking changes. |
| **MINOR** | Adds new functionality while maintaining backwards compatibility. |
| **PATCH** | Delivers backwards-compatible bug fixes and maintenance improvements. |

Examples:

| Version | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `0.1.0` | Initial development release. |
| `0.2.0` | New functionality added. |
| `0.2.3` | Maintenance release with bug fixes. |
| `1.0.0` | First stable production release. |
| `2.0.0` | Major release containing breaking changes. |

---

# Pre-release Versions

Before reaching a stable production release, BAOBAB may publish pre-release versions.

Examples include:

| Identifier | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `alpha` | Early development builds with active feature development. |
| `beta` | Feature-complete builds intended for wider evaluation and testing. |
| `rc` (Release Candidate) | Final validation before a stable release. |

Examples:

```text
0.1.0-alpha

0.5.0-beta

0.9.0-rc.1
```

Pre-release versions should not be considered production-ready unless explicitly stated.

---

# Release Principles

Every release should strive to be:

## Predictable

Users should understand what to expect from a release based on its version number.

---

## Transparent

Important changes should be documented clearly and honestly.

---

## Reliable

Releases should represent stable, tested, and review-approved milestones.

---

## Traceable

Changes should be linked to Pull Requests, Issues, discussions, or other relevant project records where appropriate.

---

## Reproducible

Each tagged release should correspond to a specific state of the repository and be reproducible through the documented build process.

---

# What Belongs in the Changelog

The changelog should include notable changes such as:

- New features.
- User-visible improvements.
- Significant architectural changes.
- Security fixes.
- Breaking changes.
- Performance improvements.
- Deprecations.
- Removed functionality.
- Operational changes affecting deployment or configuration.

Entries should be concise, factual, and written from the perspective of someone using or maintaining the platform.

---

# What Does Not Belong

- Release date
- Brief release summary

For example:

```markdown
## [1.2.0] - 2027-03-15

### Summary

This release introduces multi-tenant reporting, improves API performance, and strengthens authentication controls.
```

A concise summary helps readers quickly understand the focus of the release.

---

Example:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial support for tenant-aware reporting.

### Changed

- Improved deployment workflow for container builds.

### Fixed

- Corrected validation of tenant configuration settings.
```

Once a release is published, the entries from the **Unreleased** section should be moved into the corresponding versioned release.

---

# Maintaining the Changelog

Maintainers should update the changelog as part of the release preparation process.

Contributors are encouraged to include proposed changelog entries in Pull Requests whenever they introduce changes that are:

- User-visible.
- Operationally significant.
- Security-related.
- Architecturally important.

Reviewers should ensure that changelog entries accurately reflect the completed work before approving a release.

---

# Consistency Across Releases

To maintain a professional and predictable release history:

- Use the same section order for every release.
- Keep language consistent.
- Avoid duplicate entries.
- Group related changes together.
- Record only completed work.
- Verify accuracy before publication.

Consistency improves readability and helps users compare releases over time.
